# FSPsmallpelagics

Series of scripts to extract and analyse the data obtained from the former Fisheries Partenship Programme (FSP), now integrated in the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
for sprat, sardine and sometimes anchovy.

This repository was a first attempt to integrate the scripts I was provided from a colleague, now superseeded and therefore archived.

Data originate from the function drive Z:\FSP\FSP_small pelagics\MD007B_2122\ for the 2021 branch and Z:\FSP\FSP_small pelagics\MD007B_2223\ for the 2022 branch
